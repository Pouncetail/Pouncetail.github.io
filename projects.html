        <p>The U.S. EPA contains over 360K pesticide‐label documents—each packed with critical application and safety instructions for growers.
          However, they exist only as inconsistent PDFs that are cumbersome to search, forcing farmers to comb through lengthy documents for dosage, timing, or safety guidance.​
          Our solution harnesses state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to automatically parse and extract important data; crop, target pest or disease, application rate, safety information, and loads them into an open-source database.
          This AI-driven pipeline turns text into actionable insights, so growers can focus on farming rather than paperwork.​
          Me and my team of 6 other group members worked together to create this application, spanning over a semester.
          Additionally, we worked with our client/researcher, Dr. Scott Cosseboom, who is a senior research associate in Plant Pathology, and our CMSC435 professor, Dr. Jim Purtilo.</p>
        <p>Currently, in my software engineering course (CMSC435), I am working on a project which involves using the EPA database to give information on over 15000 pesticides.
          Each pesticide has a specific label with up to 100 pages of text of information, and we were tasked by a researcher at Cornell to create an AI model to pull the correct information from these labels and insert them into a database for world-wide usage.
          In this project, we have split up into 3 different teams, mainly the PDF parsing team, AI parsing team, and the database team.
          I am currently working on the database team, more specifically, maintaining the database and ensuring the security of the information in the database.
          Additionally, I also have taken up the role of the project manager, ensuring each team is doing their specific parts of the project and keeping up productivity to ensure we can complete this project by the end of the semester.

        <p>Everyday, millions of people fall victim to phishing attempts, scams, and identity theft.
          PhishNet AI catches these malicious websites and explains why they are dangerous using AI and anti-virus programs.
          This program comes in the form of a google chrome extension, easily accessible and usable for those even in older ages.
          With this program, we hoped to help not just everyone, but especially those in older ages who fall victim to these scams, and don’t know how to prevent them otherwise.
          We hope that with our program, we can mitigate these scams. 
          Me and my team of three other group members worked together over a span of the 2025 Bitcamp, or 2 days, to create this program, and we hope to expand upon it in the future as well.</p>
        <p>In this program, I personally worked on the backend, making sure that our program could properly communicate with the other programs already in place to make our app feasible.
          For example, part of what we used were anti-virus APIs which allowed us to access an already large database and check with those databases to see whether websites that were being accessed had scams in them.
          Additionally, as part of those anti-virus APIs, they also used their own plethora of programs that checked for general scams/phishing links.
          Looking into these APIs, I was able to connect them to the main frontend application, which is what you see in the google extension.

            PokeTypes is a game that me and my friend created to test our abilities in coding a game using HTML and Javascript, in addition to other resources like MongoDB and express.
            In this game, we take a famous game, Pokemon, and have the user guess what pokemon it is.
            Using the pokeAPI, we are able to get pictures, weights, names, and more from the large database it has.
            Then, giving just a silhouette, the elemental types, and weight of the pokemon, we have the user guess what kind of pokemon it is.
            Finally, we also have the user input a username so that we can store that inside of the MongoDB database.
            Unfortunately, this portion of the project is not running due to the MongoDB database we used being deprecated.
        </p>
        <p>
            This game was inspired off of the main Pokemon anime, where they have segments in between commercial breaks to have the viewer guess what a pokemon was based off of just a silhouette.
            Typically it's something related to the episode itself, and the theme it has revolving around it/pokemon that were being used at the time.
            Me and my friend were both very interested in Pokemon since we were young, and so making this kind of game was something that we enjoyed doing.
            In this project, we also split it up into two parts; the front and back ends.
            I worked on the frontend, which means most of the visuals you can see, including the background, the silhouettes, and textboxes.
            My friend worked on the backend, ensuring that people's scores would be inserted into the MongoDB database and linking up buttons to where they should be.

            For the typical college student, every day is filled with reading textbooks or lectures, trying to just find the one bit of information you're looking for.
            With Cramberry, We hope that this process becomes a lot easier in finding where that information is.
            First, copy paste the entire text that you're looking at, whether a full chapter from the textbook, or articles for reading.
            Then, by running the program, it will point out specific words that stood out, and hopefully, those words will be what you'll be looking for.
            Me and my team of two other group members worked together over a span of the 2024 Bitcamp, or 2 days, to create this program.
            Unfortunately, we were unable to complete this due to issues with mac and PC integration, and so it has been untouched since then.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this program, I personally worked on the frontend, making sure that our program had a user-friendly area for easy usage.
            Originally, this had been working well, and we had a general idea of how our project should work.
            As such, we were able to create a front and back end, where the front end would take in a passage and relay it to the backend, who would use AI to parse through the text.
            However, an issue that we ran into was connecting this front and back end, something that we realized too late into the deadline.
            Fortunately, the concepts are still there; the only issue we ran into was the mac to PC integration, something that we didn't originally anticipate.
            While we were unable to complete the project as a result, we still learned valuable lessons in doing this project, learning new languages and more about integration between computers.

            When I first created this website back in 2022, I wanted to try creating a game only from html.
            In fact, the html for that game is still within the repository, albiet not playable.
            It was at that time that I realized there was still so much to learn about code, and what I could learn from code to create things that I could enjoy.
            As such, I then started documenting everything I had done instead on this website, starting with this website itself!
            This website both serves as a way to others what I have accomplished as well as a way to track myself what I've learned and how I've grown in this field of study.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website was probably one of the first projects I ever really worked on, and looking back, I had very bad naming conventions, horrible organization, and generally very basic coding skills.
            However, it also serves as a great checkpoint in what I've done up till today, how much I've grown since that day I stepped onto UMD.
            I've learned a lot since then, including learning more about what I do best in coding, how I can leverage that in my day to day, and where I can use it besides just coding.
            From the bottom to the top, they represent my journey, the top being my most recent project, and the bottom being the ones that have begun to collect dust.
            With this website, I have been able to breath new life into it thanks to the e-portfolio assignment, and I hope to continue to use this in the future to further document my journey.
