          From a young age, I remember being surrounded by continually improving technology -- as I watched innovations like the iPhone take off, I took an immediate interest in computers.
          I developed this interest by learning how to program in Scratch, creating basic platforming games, which continued into my middle and high school years.
          I fostered this passion for technology as I transitioned to college in the fall of 2022, when I started my University of Maryland (UMD) experience as an undergraduate.
          In my undergraduate experience, I have refined my knowledge of computer science, learning the intracacies of coding langauges, and recreating them and creating my own projects.
          Thanks to these experiences, I reaffirmed my desire to study CS, and look forward to pursuing a CS-oriented career!

          In my pursuit of my undergraduate CS degree, I have learned many different themes not only about myself, but also about the work surrounding coding.
          I've realized that as a video gamer, I loved being able to dissect each part of a game down to its bare bones and imagining how I could recreate that in my own time.
          This is why multiple of my artifacts revolve around games, and is part of my core values as a coder; I want to be able to make something that can make people happy.
          Additionally, this is what also made me want to do more community kinds of projects, such as my SPROUT and PhishNet projects, which both give something back to a community that has supported me thus far.
          I hope that as as I head into my Senior year of Fall 2025, I am able to continue my passion to create both projects that bring people joy and are also useful to everyday life.
