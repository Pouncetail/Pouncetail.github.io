        <p>From a young age, I remember being surrounded by continually improving technology -- as I watched innovations like the iPhone take off, I took an immediate interest in computers. I developed this interest by learning how to program in Scratch, creating basic platforming games, which continued into my middle and high school years. I fostered this passion for technology as I transitioned to college in the fall of 2022, when I started my University of Maryland (UMD) experience as an undergraduate. In my first semester, I took Computer Science (CS) classes and participated in CS-related clubs, such as the Game Development club. Thanks to these experiences, I reaffirmed my desire to study CS, and look forward to pursuing a CS-oriented career!</p>

        <p>The U.S. EPA contains over 360K pesticide‐label documents—each packed with critical application and safety instructions for growers.
          However, they exist only as inconsistent PDFs that are cumbersome to search, forcing farmers to comb through lengthy documents for dosage, timing, or safety guidance.​
          Our solution harnesses state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to automatically parse and extract important data; crop, target pest or disease, application rate, safety information, and loads them into an open-source database.
          This AI-driven pipeline turns text into actionable insights, so growers can focus on farming rather than paperwork.​
          Me and my team of 6 other group members worked together to create this application, spanning over a semester.
          Additionally, we worked with our client/researcher, Dr. Scott Cosseboom, who is a senior research associate in Plant Pathology, and our CMSC435 professor, Dr. Jim Purtilo.</p>
        <p>Currently, in my software engineering course (CMSC435), I am working on a project which involves using the EPA database to give information on over 15000 pesticides.
          Each pesticide has a specific label with up to 100 pages of text of information, and we were tasked by a researcher at Cornell to create an AI model to pull the correct information from these labels and insert them into a database for world-wide usage.
          In this project, we have split up into 3 different teams, mainly the PDF parsing team, AI parsing team, and the database team.
          I am currently working on the database team, more specifically, maintaining the database and ensuring the security of the information in the database.
          Additionally, I also have taken up the role of the project manager, ensuring each team is doing their specific parts of the project and keeping up productivity to ensure we can complete this project by the end of the semester.

        <p>Everyday, millions of people fall victim to phishing attempts, scams, and identity theft.
          PhishNet AI catches these malicious websites and explains why they are dangerous using AI and anti-virus programs.
          This program comes in the form of a google chrome extension, easily accessible and usable for those even in older ages.
          With this program, we hoped to help not just everyone, but especially those in older ages who fall victim to these scams, and don’t know how to prevent them otherwise.
          We hope that with our program, we can mitigate these scams. 
          Me and my team of three other group members worked together over a span of the 2025 Bitcamp, or 2 days, to create this program, and we hope to expand upon it in the future as well.</p>
        <p>In this program, I personally worked on the backend, making sure that our program could properly communicate with the other programs already in place to make our app feasible.
          For example, part of what we used were anti-virus APIs which allowed us to access an already large database and check with those databases to see whether websites that were being accessed had scams in them.
          Additionally, as part of those anti-virus APIs, they also used their own plethora of programs that checked for general scams/phishing links.
          Looking into these APIs, I was able to connect them to the main frontend application, which is what you see in the google extension.
