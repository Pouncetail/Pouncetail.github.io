        <p>From a young age, I remember being surrounded by continually improving technology -- as I watched innovations like the iPhone take off, I took an immediate interest in computers. I developed this interest by learning how to program in Scratch, creating basic platforming games, which continued into my middle and high school years. I fostered this passion for technology as I transitioned to college in the fall of 2022, when I started my University of Maryland (UMD) experience as an undergraduate. In my first semester, I took Computer Science (CS) classes and participated in CS-related clubs, such as the Game Development club. Thanks to these experiences, I reaffirmed my desire to study CS, and look forward to pursuing a CS-oriented career!</p>
